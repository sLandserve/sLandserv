\title{Create landscapes of ecosystem service supply (ecological) and demand (social) patches}
\usage{
ls_create(nrow, ncol, p_supply, p_demand, f_supply, f_demand, inter)
}
\arguments{
\item{nrow}{Number of rows in the raster}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the raster}

\item{p_supply}{Proportion of the landscape which is ES supply}

\item{p_demand}{Proportion of the landscape which is ES demand}

\item{f_supply}{Fragmentation level of the ES supply (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
the most fragmented)}

\item{f_demand}{Fragmentation level of the ES supply (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
the most fragmented)}

\item{inter}{Interpersion between ES supply and demand (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
completely interspersed)}
}
\value{
A list containing a raster of the supply, demand, and if appropriate (p_supply +
 p_demand != 1) neutral landcover types, a polygon containing the supply patches, a
 polygon containing the demand patches and the parameters used to generate it
}
\description{
`ls_create` simulates ecosystem service supply and demand landscapes based
 on a number of parameters: proportion of supply/demand; fragmentation of
 supply/demand; interspersion of supply/demand
