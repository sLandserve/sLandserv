#'Create landscapes of ecosystem service supply (ecological) and demand (social) patches
#'
#'@description `ls_create` simulates ecosystem service supply and demand landscapes based
#'  on a number of parameters: proportion of supply/demand; fragmentation of
#'  supply/demand; interspersion of supply/demand
#'
#'@param nrow Number of rows in the raster
#'
#'@param ncol Number of columns in the raster
#'
#'@param p_supply Proportion of the landscape which is ES supply
#'
#'@param p_demand Proportion of the landscape which is ES demand
#'
#'@param f_supply Fragmentation level of the ES supply (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
#'  the most fragmented)
#'
#'@param f_demand Fragmentation level of the ES supply (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
#'  the most fragmented)
#'
#'@param inter Interpersion between ES supply and demand (in the range [0, 1] with 1 being
#'  completely interspersed)
#'
#'@param rep This is an integer which is just to keep track of which replicate results are from
#'
#'@return A list containing a raster of the supply, demand, and if appropriate (p_supply +
#'  p_demand != 1) neutral landcover types and the parameters used to generate it
#'
